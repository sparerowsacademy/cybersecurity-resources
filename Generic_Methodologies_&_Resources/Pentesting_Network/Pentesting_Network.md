**Discovering hosts from the outside** <br>

This is going to be a **brief section** about how to find **IPs responding** from the **Internet.**
In this situation you have some **scope of IPs** (maybe even several **ranges**) and you just to find **which Ps are responding.**

**ICMP** <br>

This is the **easiest** and **fastest** way to discover if a host is up or not.<br>
You could try to send some **ICMP** packets and **expect responses.** The easiest way is just sending an **echo request** and expect from the response. You can do that using a simple pingor using  *fping* for **ranges.** <br>

You could also use **nmap** to send other types of ICMP packets (this will avoid filters to common ICMP echo request-response).

      ping -c 1 199.66.11.4    # 1 echo request to a host
      fping -g 199.66.11.0/24  # Send echo requests to ranges
      nmap -PE -PM -PP -sn -n 199.66.11.0/24 #Send echo, timestamp requests and subnet mask requests

**TCP Port Discovery** <br>

It's very common to find that all kind of ICMP packets are being filtered. Then, all you can do to check if a host is up is **try to find open ports.** Each host has **65535 ports,** so, if you have a "big" scope you **cannot** test if **each port** of each host is open or not, that will take too much time.
Then, what you need is a **fast port scanner** ([masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan))and a list of the **ports more used:**

     #Using masscan to scan top20ports of nmap in a /24 range (less than 5min)
     masscan -p20,21-23,25,53,80,110,111,135,139,143,443,445,993,995,1723,3306,3389,5900,8080 199.66.11.0/24

You could also perform this step with *nmap*, but it slower and somewhat *nmap* has problems identifying hosts up.

**HTTP Port Discovery** <br>

This is just a TCP port discovery useful when you want to focus on discovering HTTP services:
    
     masscan -p80,443,8000-8100,8443 199.66.11.0/24

**UDP Port Discovery**<br>

You could also try to check for some **UDP port open** to decide if you should **pay more attention** to a **host.** As UDP services usually **don't respond** with **any data** to a regular empty UDP probe packet it is difficult to say if a port is being filtered or open. The easiest way to decide this is to send a packet related to the running service, and as you don't know which service is running, you should try the most probable based on the port number:

    nmap -sU -sV --version-intensity 0 -F -n 199.66.11.53/24
    # The -sV will make nmap test each possible known UDP service packet
    # The "--version-intensity 0" will make nmap only test the most probable

The nmap line proposed before will test the **top 1000 UDP ports** in every host inside the /24 range but even only this will take **20min.** If need **fastest results** you can use [udp-proto-scanner:](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/udp-proto-scanner) .**/udp-proto-scanner.pl 199.66.11.53/24**This will send these **UDP probes** to their **expected port** (for a /24 range this will just take 1 min): *DNSStatusRequest, DNSVersionBindReq, NBTStat, NTPRequest, RPCCheck, SNMPv3GetRequest, chargen, citrix, daytime, db2, echo, gtpv1, ike,ms-sql, ms-sql-slam, netop, ntp, rpc, snmp-public, systat, tftp, time, xdmcp.*

**SCTP Port Discovery** <br>

       #Probably useless, but it's pretty fast, why not try it?
       nmap -T4 -sY -n --open -Pn <IP/range>

**Pentesting Wifi** <br>
Here you can find a nice guide of all the well known Wifi attacks at the time of the writing:

**Discovering hosts from the inside**<br>

If you are inside the network one of the first things you will want to do is to discover other hosts. Depending on how much noise you can/want to do, different actions could be performed:

**Passive** <br>

You can use these tools to passively discover hosts inside a connected network:

       netdiscover -p
       p0f -i eth0 -p -o /tmp/p0f.log
       # Bettercap
       net.recon on/off #Read local ARP cache periodically
       net.show
       set net.show.meta true #more info

**Active**<br>
Note that the techniques commented in (Discovering hosts from the outside) *(TCP/HTTP/UDP/SCTP Port Discovery)* can be also *applied here.*
But, as you are in the **same network** as the other hosts, you can do **more things:**

       #ARP discovery
        nmap -sn <Network> #ARP Requests (Discover IPs)
        netdiscover -r <Network> #ARP requests (Discover IPs)

        #NBT discovery
        nbtscan -r 192.168.0.1/24 #Search in Domain

        # Bettercap
        net.probe on/off #Discover hosts on current subnet by probing with ARP, mDNS, NBNS, UPNP, and/or WSD
        set net.probe.mdns true/false #Enable mDNS discovery probes (default=true)
        set net.probe.nbns true/false #Enable NetBIOS name service discovery probes (default=true)
        set net.probe.upnp true/false #Enable UPNP discovery probes (default=true)
        set net.probe.wsd true/false #Enable WSD discovery probes (default=true)
        set net.probe.throttle 10 #10ms between probes sent (default=10)

        #IPv6
        alive6 <IFACE> # Send a pingv6 to multicast.

**Active ICMP** 

Note that the techniques commented in Discovering hosts from the outside (ICMP) can be also **applied here.**
But, as you are in the *same network* as the other hosts, you can do *more things:*

❃ If you **ping** a **subnet broadcast address** the ping should be arrive to **each host** and they could **respond** to **you:** *ping -b 10.10.5.255*

❃ Pinging the **network broadcast address** you could even find hosts inside **other subnets:** ping -b 255.255.255.255*

❃ Use the   -PE,   -PP, -PM flags of nmapto perform host discovery sending respectively **ICMPv4 echo, timestamp,** and **subnet mask requests:** *nmap -PE -PM -PP -sn -vvv -n 10.12.5.0/24*


**Wake On Lan**

Wake On Lan is used to **turn on** computers through a **network message.** The magic packet used to turn on the computer is only a packet where a **MAC Dst** is provided and then it is **repeated 16 times** inside the same paket.
Then this kind of packets are usually sent in an **ethernet 0x0842** or in a **UDP packet to port 9.**
If no **[MAC]** is provided, the packet is sent to **broadcast ethernet** (and the broadcast MAC will be the one being repeated).

          # Bettercap (if no [MAC] is specificed ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff will be used/entire broadcast domain)
      wol.eth [MAC] #Send a WOL as a raw ethernet packet of type 0x0847
      wol.udp [MAC] #Send a WOL as an IPv4 broadcast packet to UDP port 9

**Scanning Hosts**

Once you have discovered all the IPs (external or internal) you want to scan in depth, different actions can be performed.

**TCP**
❃ **Open port:** SYN --> SYN/ACK --> RST

❃ **Closed port:** SYN --> RST/ACK

❃ **Filtered port:** SYN --> [NO RESPONSE]

❃ **Filtered port:** SYN --> ICMP message

     # Nmap fast scan for the most 1000tcp ports used
     nmap -sV -sC -O -T4 -n -Pn -oA fastscan <IP> 
     # Nmap fast scan for all the ports
     nmap -sV -sC -O -T4 -n -Pn -p- -oA fullfastscan <IP> 
    # Nmap fast scan for all the ports slower to avoid failures due to -T4
     nmap -sV -sC -O -p- -n -Pn -oA fullscan <IP>

    #Bettercap Scan
    syn.scan 192.168.1.0/24 1 10000 #Ports 1-10000

**UDP**
There are 2 options to scan an UDP port:

❃ Send a **UDP packet** and check for the response ***ICMP unreachable*** if the port is **closed** (in several cases ICMP will be **filtered** so you won't receive any information inf the port is close or open).

❃ Send a **formatted datagrams** to elicit a response from a **service** (e.g., DNS, DHCP, TFTP, and others, as listed in nmap-payloads). If you receive a **response,** then, the port is **open.**

**Nmap** will **mix both** options using "-sV" (UDP scans are very slow), but notice that UDP scans are slower than TCP scans:

    # Check if any of the most common udp services is running
     udp-proto-scanner.pl <IP> 
    # Nmap fast check if any of the 100 most common UDP services is running
     nmap -sU -sV --version-intensity 0 -n -F -T4 <IP>
    # Nmap check if any of the 100 most common UDP services is running and launch defaults scripts
     nmap -sU -sV -sC -n -F -T4 <IP> 
    # Nmap "fast" top 1000 UDP ports
     nmap -sU -sV --version-intensity 0 -n -T4 <IP>
    # You could use nmap to test all the UDP ports, but that will take a lot of time

**SCTP Scan**
**SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)** is designed to be used alongside **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol).** Its main purpose is to facilitate the transport of telephony data over IP networks, mirroring many of the reliability features found in **Signaling System 7 (SS7)**. SCTP is a core component of the **SIGTRAN** protocol family, which aims to transport SS7 signals over IP networks.

The support for **SCTP** is provided by various operating systems, such as **IBM AIX, Oracle Solaris, HP-UX, Linux, Cisco IOS,** and **VxWorks,** indicating its broad acceptance and utility in the field of telecommunication and networking.

Two different scans for SCTP are offered by nmap: -sY and -sZ

    # Nmap fast SCTP scan
      nmap -T4 -sY -n -oA SCTFastScan <IP>
    # Nmap all SCTP scan
      nmap -T4 -p- -sY -sV -sC -F -n -oA SCTAllScan <IP>

**Revealing Internal IP Addresses**

**Misconfigured routers, firewalls, and network devices** sometimes respond to network probes using **nonpublic source addresses. tcpdump** can be utilized to identify packets received from private addresses during testing. Specifically, on Kali Linux, packets can be captured on the eth2 interface, which is accessible from the public Internet. It's important to note that if your setup is behind a NAT or a Firewall, such packets are likely to be filtered out.

       tcpdump –nt -i eth2 src net 10 or 172.16/12 or 192.168/16
       tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
       listening on eth2, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes
       IP 10.10.0.1 > 185.22.224.18: ICMP echo reply, id 25804, seq 1582, length 64
       IP 10.10.0.2 > 185.22.224.18: ICMP echo reply, id 25804, seq 1586, length 64

**Sniffing**

Sniffing you can learn details of IP ranges, subnet sizes, MAC addresses, and hostnames by reviewing captured frames and packets. If the network is misconfigured or switching fabric under stress, attackers can capture sensitive material via passive network sniffing.

If a switched Ethernet network is configured properly, you will only see broadcast frames and material destined for your MAC address.

**TCPDump**

        sudo tcpdump -i <INTERFACE> udp port 53 #Listen to DNS request to discover what is searching the host
        tcpdump -i <IFACE> icmp #Listen to icmp packets
        sudo bash -c "sudo nohup tcpdump -i eth0 -G 300 -w \"/tmp/dump-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S-%s.pcap\" -W 50 'tcp and (port 80 or port 443)' &"

One can, also, capture packets from a remote machine over an SSH session with Wireshark as the GUI in realtime.

       ssh user@<TARGET IP> tcpdump -i ens160 -U -s0 -w - | sudo wireshark -k -i -
       ssh <USERNAME>@<TARGET IP> tcpdump -i <INTERFACE> -U -s0 -w - 'port not 22' | sudo wireshark -k -i - # Exclude SSH traffic

**Bettercap**
       net.sniff on
       net.sniff stats
       set net.sniff.output sniffed.pcap #Write captured packets to file
       set net.sniff.local  #If true it will consider packets from/to this computer, otherwise it will skip them (default=false)
       set net.sniff.filter #BPF filter for the sniffer (default=not arp)
       set net.sniff.regexp #If set only packets matching this regex will be considered
**Wireshark**

Obviously.

**Capturing credentials**

You can use tools like [https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz] to parse credentials from a pcap or a live interface.

**LAN attacks**

**ARP spoofing**

ARP Spoofing consist on sending gratuitous ARPResponses to indicate that the IP of a machine has the MAC of our device. Then, the victim will change the ARP table and will contact our machine every time it wants to contact the IP spoofed.

**Bettercap**
         arp.spoof on
         set arp.spoof.targets <IP> #Specific targets to ARP spoof (default=<entire subnet>)
         set arp.spoof.whitelist #Specific targets to skip while spoofing
         set arp.spoof.fullduplex true #If true, both the targets and the gateway will be attacked, otherwise only the target (default=false)
         set arp.spoof.internal true #If true, local connections among computers of the network will be spoofed, otherwise only connections going to and coming from the Internet (default=false)

**Arpspoof**

         echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
         arpspoof -t 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2
         arpspoof -t 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.1

**MAC Flooding - CAM overflow**

Overflow the switch’s CAM table sending a lot of packets with different source mac address. When the CAM table is full the switch start behaving like a hub (broadcasting all the traffic).

          macof -i <interface>
In modern switches this vulnerability has been fixed.

**802.1Q VLAN / DTP Attacks**

**Dynamic Trunking**

The **Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)** is designed as a link layer protocol to facilitate an automatic system for trunking, allowing switches to automatically select ports for trunk mode (Trunk) or non-trunk mode. The deployment of **DTP** is often seen as indicative of suboptimal network design, underscoring the importance of manually configuring trunks only where necessary and ensuring proper documentation.

By default, switch ports are set to operate in Dynamic Auto mode, meaning they are ready to initiate trunking if prompted by a neighboring switch. A security concern arises when a pentester or attacker connects to the switch and sends a DTP Desirable frame, compelling the port to enter trunk mode. This action enables the attacker to enumerate VLANs through STP frame analysis and circumvent VLAN segmentation by setting up virtual interfaces.

The presence of DTP in many switches by default can be exploited by adversaries to mimic a switch's behavior, thereby gaining access to traffic across all VLANs. The script dtpscan.sh is utilized to monitor an interface, revealing whether a switch is in Default, Trunk, Dynamic, Auto, or Access mode—the latter being the only configuration immune to VLAN hopping attacks. This tool assesses the switch's vulnerability status.

Should network vulnerability be identified, the **Yersinia** tool can be employed to "enable trunking" via the DTP protocol, allowing for the observation of packets from all VLANs.

           apt-get install yersinia #Installation
           sudo apt install kali-linux-large #Another way to install it in Kali
           yersinia -I #Interactive mode
           #In interactive mode you will need to select a interface first
           #Then, you can select the protocol to attack using letter "g"
           #Finally, you can select the attack using letter "x"

           yersinia -G #For graphic mode

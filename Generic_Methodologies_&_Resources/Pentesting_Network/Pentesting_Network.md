**Discovering hosts from the outside** <br>

This is going to be a **brief section** about how to find **IPs responding** from the **Internet.**
In this situation you have some **scope of IPs** (maybe even several **ranges**) and you just to find **which Ps are responding.**

**ICMP** <br>

This is the **easiest** and **fastest** way to discover if a host is up or not.<br>
You could try to send some **ICMP** packets and **expect responses.** The easiest way is just sending an **echo request** and expect from the response. You can do that using a simple pingor using  *fping* for **ranges.** <br>

You could also use **nmap** to send other types of ICMP packets (this will avoid filters to common ICMP echo request-response).

      ping -c 1 199.66.11.4    # 1 echo request to a host
      fping -g 199.66.11.0/24  # Send echo requests to ranges
      nmap -PE -PM -PP -sn -n 199.66.11.0/24 #Send echo, timestamp requests and subnet mask requests

**TCP Port Discovery** <br>

It's very common to find that all kind of ICMP packets are being filtered. Then, all you can do to check if a host is up is **try to find open ports.** Each host has **65535 ports,** so, if you have a "big" scope you **cannot** test if **each port** of each host is open or not, that will take too much time.
Then, what you need is a **fast port scanner** ([masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan))and a list of the **ports more used:**

     #Using masscan to scan top20ports of nmap in a /24 range (less than 5min)
     masscan -p20,21-23,25,53,80,110,111,135,139,143,443,445,993,995,1723,3306,3389,5900,8080 199.66.11.0/24

You could also perform this step with *nmap*, but it slower and somewhat *nmap* has problems identifying hosts up.

**HTTP Port Discovery** <br>

This is just a TCP port discovery useful when you want to focus on discovering HTTP services:
    
     masscan -p80,443,8000-8100,8443 199.66.11.0/24

**UDP Port Discovery**<br>

You could also try to check for some **UDP port open** to decide if you should **pay more attention** to a **host.** As UDP services usually **don't respond** with **any data** to a regular empty UDP probe packet it is difficult to say if a port is being filtered or open. The easiest way to decide this is to send a packet related to the running service, and as you don't know which service is running, you should try the most probable based on the port number:

    nmap -sU -sV --version-intensity 0 -F -n 199.66.11.53/24
    # The -sV will make nmap test each possible known UDP service packet
    # The "--version-intensity 0" will make nmap only test the most probable

The nmap line proposed before will test the **top 1000 UDP ports** in every host inside the /24 range but even only this will take **20min.** If need **fastest results** you can use [udp-proto-scanner:](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/udp-proto-scanner) .**/udp-proto-scanner.pl 199.66.11.53/24**This will send these **UDP probes** to their **expected port** (for a /24 range this will just take 1 min): *DNSStatusRequest, DNSVersionBindReq, NBTStat, NTPRequest, RPCCheck, SNMPv3GetRequest, chargen, citrix, daytime, db2, echo, gtpv1, ike,ms-sql, ms-sql-slam, netop, ntp, rpc, snmp-public, systat, tftp, time, xdmcp.*

**SCTP Port Discovery** <br>

       #Probably useless, but it's pretty fast, why not try it?
       nmap -T4 -sY -n --open -Pn <IP/range>

**Discovering hosts from the inside**<br>

If you are inside the network one of the first things you will want to do is to discover other hosts. Depending on how much noise you can/want to do, different actions could be performed:

**Passive** <br>

You can use these tools to passively discover hosts inside a connected network:

       netdiscover -p
       p0f -i eth0 -p -o /tmp/p0f.log
       # Bettercap
       net.recon on/off #Read local ARP cache periodically
       net.show
       set net.show.meta true #more info

**Active**<br>
Note that the techniques commented in (Discovering hosts from the outside) *(TCP/HTTP/UDP/SCTP Port Discovery)* can be also *applied here.*
But, as you are in the **same network** as the other hosts, you can do **more things:**

       #ARP discovery
        nmap -sn <Network> #ARP Requests (Discover IPs)
        netdiscover -r <Network> #ARP requests (Discover IPs)

        #NBT discovery
        nbtscan -r 192.168.0.1/24 #Search in Domain

        # Bettercap
        net.probe on/off #Discover hosts on current subnet by probing with ARP, mDNS, NBNS, UPNP, and/or WSD
        set net.probe.mdns true/false #Enable mDNS discovery probes (default=true)
        set net.probe.nbns true/false #Enable NetBIOS name service discovery probes (default=true)
        set net.probe.upnp true/false #Enable UPNP discovery probes (default=true)
        set net.probe.wsd true/false #Enable WSD discovery probes (default=true)
        set net.probe.throttle 10 #10ms between probes sent (default=10)

        #IPv6
        alive6 <IFACE> # Send a pingv6 to multicast.

**Active ICMP** 

Note that the techniques commented in Discovering hosts from the outside (ICMP) can be also **applied here.**
But, as you are in the *same network* as the other hosts, you can do *more things:*

❃ If you **ping** a **subnet broadcast address** the ping should be arrive to **each host** and they could **respond** to **you:** *ping -b 10.10.5.255*

❃ Pinging the **network broadcast address** you could even find hosts inside **other subnets:** ping -b 255.255.255.255*

❃ Use the   -PE,   -PP, -PM flags of nmapto perform host discovery sending respectively **ICMPv4 echo, timestamp,** and **subnet mask requests:** *nmap -PE -PM -PP -sn -vvv -n 10.12.5.0/24*


**Wake On Lan**

Wake On Lan is used to **turn on** computers through a **network message.** The magic packet used to turn on the computer is only a packet where a **MAC Dst** is provided and then it is **repeated 16 times** inside the same paket.
Then this kind of packets are usually sent in an **ethernet 0x0842** or in a **UDP packet to port 9.**
If no **[MAC]** is provided, the packet is sent to **broadcast ethernet** (and the broadcast MAC will be the one being repeated).

          # Bettercap (if no [MAC] is specificed ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff will be used/entire broadcast domain)
      wol.eth [MAC] #Send a WOL as a raw ethernet packet of type 0x0847
      wol.udp [MAC] #Send a WOL as an IPv4 broadcast packet to UDP port 9

**Scanning Hosts**

Once you have discovered all the IPs (external or internal) you want to scan in depth, different actions can be performed.

**TCP**
❃ **Open port:** SYN --> SYN/ACK --> RST

❃ **Closed port:** SYN --> RST/ACK

❃ **Filtered port:** SYN --> [NO RESPONSE]

❃ **Filtered port:** SYN --> ICMP message

     # Nmap fast scan for the most 1000tcp ports used
     nmap -sV -sC -O -T4 -n -Pn -oA fastscan <IP> 
     # Nmap fast scan for all the ports
     nmap -sV -sC -O -T4 -n -Pn -p- -oA fullfastscan <IP> 
    # Nmap fast scan for all the ports slower to avoid failures due to -T4
     nmap -sV -sC -O -p- -n -Pn -oA fullscan <IP>

    #Bettercap Scan
    syn.scan 192.168.1.0/24 1 10000 #Ports 1-10000

**UDP**
There are 2 options to scan an UDP port:

❃ Send a **UDP packet** and check for the response ***ICMP unreachable*** if the port is **closed** (in several cases ICMP will be **filtered** so you won't receive any information inf the port is close or open).

❃ Send a **formatted datagrams** to elicit a response from a **service** (e.g., DNS, DHCP, TFTP, and others, as listed in nmap-payloads). If you receive a **response,** then, the port is **open.**

**Nmap** will **mix both** options using "-sV" (UDP scans are very slow), but notice that UDP scans are slower than TCP scans:

    # Check if any of the most common udp services is running
     udp-proto-scanner.pl <IP> 
    # Nmap fast check if any of the 100 most common UDP services is running
     nmap -sU -sV --version-intensity 0 -n -F -T4 <IP>
    # Nmap check if any of the 100 most common UDP services is running and launch defaults scripts
     nmap -sU -sV -sC -n -F -T4 <IP> 
    # Nmap "fast" top 1000 UDP ports
     nmap -sU -sV --version-intensity 0 -n -T4 <IP>
    # You could use nmap to test all the UDP ports, but that will take a lot of time

**SCTP Scan**
**SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)** is designed to be used alongside **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol).** Its main purpose is to facilitate the transport of telephony data over IP networks, mirroring many of the reliability features found in **Signaling System 7 (SS7)**. SCTP is a core component of the **SIGTRAN** protocol family, which aims to transport SS7 signals over IP networks.

The support for **SCTP** is provided by various operating systems, such as **IBM AIX, Oracle Solaris, HP-UX, Linux, Cisco IOS,** and **VxWorks,** indicating its broad acceptance and utility in the field of telecommunication and networking.

Two different scans for SCTP are offered by nmap: -sY and -sZ

    # Nmap fast SCTP scan
      nmap -T4 -sY -n -oA SCTFastScan <IP>
    # Nmap all SCTP scan
      nmap -T4 -p- -sY -sV -sC -F -n -oA SCTAllScan <IP>

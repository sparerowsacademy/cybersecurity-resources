**Detailed Explanation of DHCPv6 Message Types:**

❃ **Solicit (1):** Initiated by a DHCPv6 client to find available servers.

❃ **Advertise (2):** Sent by servers in response to a Solicit, indicating availability for DHCP service.

❃ **Request (3):** Clients use this to request IP addresses or prefixes from a specific server.

❃ **Confirm (4):** Used by a client to verify if the assigned addresses are still valid on the network, typically after a network change.

❃ **Renew (5):** Clients send this to the original server to extend address lifetimes or update configurations.

❃ **Rebind (6):** Sent to any server to extend address lifetimes or update configurations, especially when no response is received to a Renew.

❃ **Reply (7):** Servers use this to provide addresses, configuration parameters, or to acknowledge messages like Release or Decline.

❃ **Release (8):** Clients inform the server to stop using one or more assigned addresses.

❃ **Decline (9):** Sent by clients to report that assigned addresses are in conflict on the network.

❃ **Reconfigure (10):** Servers prompt clients to initiate transactions for new or updated configurations.

❃ **Information-Request (11):** Clients request configuration parameters without IP address assignment.

❃ **Relay-Forw (12):** Relay agents forward messages to servers.

❃ **Relay-Repl (13):** Servers reply to relay agents, who then deliver the message to the client.

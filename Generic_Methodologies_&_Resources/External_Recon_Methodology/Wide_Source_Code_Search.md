**Wide Source Code Search**

The goal of this page is to enumerate ***platforms that allow to search for code*** (literal or regex) in across thousands/millions of repos in one or more platforms.

This helps in several occasions to ***search for leaked information*** or for ***vulnerabilities*** patterns.

**<ins>SourceGraph:</ins>** Search in millions of repos. There is a free version and an enterprise version (with 15 days free). It supports regexes.

**<ins>Github Search:</ins>** Search across Github. It supports regexes.

  >Maybe it's also useful to check also <ins>Github Code Search.</ins>

**<ins>Gitlab Advanced Search:</ins>** Search across Gitlab projects. Support regexes.

**<ins>SearchCode:</ins>** Search code in millions of projects.

*When you look for leaks in a repo and run something like ***git log -p*** don't forget there might be ***other branches with other commits*** containing secrets!*
